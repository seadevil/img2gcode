zoom-canvas
===========

0.9 - First public version

0.9.1 - bugfixing
* Fix for MouseWheel event handling on Unix/linux (x11)
* Workaround patch for Bug "MouseWheel on Mac" 
* Fix for MouseWheel event handling on "win32" for tcltk 8.6b2 and later

1.0 - point item-type
* added -pointbmp option and ability to specify/change single point's bitmap.
* documentation updated

1.0.1 - fixed (mitigated) "zoomfit" bug
* "zoomfit" method was inherently imprecise due to underlying bbox command 
  whose "return value may overestimate the actual bounding box by a few pixel".
  Now "zoomfit" method is simply "less" imprecise
  Now "zoomfit" takes care of canvas border and highlightthickness, too.
  
1.0.2 - Added missing C2V and V2C methods !

1.0.3 - BUG-Fix : MouseWheel error on x11 (Linux)
